                    Choffe is a fictional coffee shop that pretends to exist in Metro Vancouver. The name 'Choffe' is a creative combination of 'Choco' and 'Coffee.' They are passionate about serving the best waffles and coffee in town, using only the finest ingredients and brewing techniques.

                    <h3>Idea Plan</h3>
                    <p>The idea of this project is because I have always wanted to create my own coffee shop, so this landing page could possibly be my pre-business website. I have also incorporated elements that I like, such as coffee and waffles. The name is a combination of my pet rabbit Choco's name and the word "coffee".

                    <p>The process of this project starts with from creating the brand design to web development. In the project, I want to showcase some fundamental knowledge about web development, such as working with HTML and JavaScript, as well as utilizing Tailwind, the frameworks CSS.</p>

                    <p>
                    For the logo design, I created a floral pattern that resembles a waffle a the main logo/icon. The floral element actually represents the shape of a waffle and also symbolizes the thick paper filter used in pour-over coffee brewing. The perspective is from a top-down view.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using an orange color scheme as the primary color is because orange-yellow tones can stimulate people's appetite, and it also represents the color of waffles.</p>

                    <p>
                    For the part of web development, I used Tailwind CSS to complete the styling of the entire website this time. The challenge I'm facing is learning how to use Tailwind to code the hamburger menu, using and applying a plugin to create the slider section.

                        <p>As this website primarily aims to provide information to users about the products available in store so the website doesn‚Äôt contain e-commerce services. However, the website's navigation consists of sections such as About, Menu, Shop, and Contact, which not only allow users to learn about the services and products offered by the store, but also offers shop information such as location and opening hour to users.</p>

                        <p>In order to have a better user experience of the website, I used media queries to make the three different device sizes responsively and used grid for the basic layout of the website. </p>
                        <p>Since Tailwind CSS follows a mobile-first approach, I utilized the default breakpoints provided by Tailwind and specifically targeted the medium (md) and large (lg) breakpoints to address tablet and desktop sizes respectively.</p>
                        <p>In terms of layout and design, I employed a grid system to ensure responsiveness across different devices. The grid system was primarily configured using the medium (md) and large (lg) breakpoints to create a responsive design for tablet and desktop sizes. By using grid-based layout techniques, I aimed to provide a consistent and visually pleasing experience for users across various devices.</p>
